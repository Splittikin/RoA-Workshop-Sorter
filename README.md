# RoA-Workshop-Sorter
Here is a Python script that will search all of your Rivals of Aether workhop items, & sort them out alphabetically. Ideal for those who have an extremely large amount of Workshop items installed & are having trouble quickly finding specific items.

### But why?
I have an absolutely colossal amount of characters installed, so many infact, that it can take ages for me to find that ONE character im looking for! I play online with my friends quite often, so we all have the same items installed. For them it often takes them a long time to find their characters as well, adding up to even more time lost between rounds. After it all, we often spend more time outside of rounds looking for our favorite characters than, you know, actually playing the game.
I could just sort them manually, but not only would that take an unreasonable amount of time and effort, but there would also be no easy way for me to then transfer that sorting to my friends, as each order.roa file is set up slightly differently based on your system, so just sending them the order.roa file would not work. Not to mention that removing a character from your subscriptions in the middle of a category causes several of your characters to shift between categories- making it not only a pain to setup, but a pain to maintain too.

The solution? Write a script that does it automatically, alphabetically! No more asking, "Hey, what page is Mollo on?", just look over in the M category! This also solves the issue of non-transferrable order.roa files, as the same set of characters gives the same sort but tailored to each system to work.

(If you don't have many characters installed, then this probably won't be very useful to you. You can still use it anyway if you want to, though.)


This is my first real utility program that I'm distributing around to others to freely use, so please give feedback! Let me know if you encounter any issues, have suggestions, or know of a way of improving it!
